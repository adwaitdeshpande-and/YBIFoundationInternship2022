YBI Foundation Internship Nov-Dec 2022

I had the pleasure of participating in the YBI Foundation Internship Program and it was an incredibly positive experience. The program provided me with a wealth of knowledge and a great opportunity to network with other interns and gain insight into different career paths. I was provided with excellent guidance and support from the program's coordinators, and I was even given an amazing opportunity to attend a professional development workshop. The internship program also gave me the chance to get hands-on experience and gain valuable skills that will be useful for the future. Overall, I highly recommend the YBI Foundation Internship Program for anyone looking for a great learning experience that will help them grow professionally.
